## Source Data Used for Analysis Dataset Creation

The ADaM datasets were derived from SDTM version 1.2. For traceability, the SDTM is publicly available at the [PHUSE Github Repository](https://github.com/cdisc-org/sdtm-adam-pilot-project/tree/master/updated-pilot-submission-package/900172/m5/datasets/cdiscpilot01/tabulations/sdtm).

Which can be traced back to the original [CDISC SDTM & ADaM Pilot Project](https://github.com/cdisc-org/sdtm-adam-pilot-project).

## Treatment Variables

ARM versus TRT01P

```         
  Are the values of ARM equivalent in meaning to values of TRT01P?

    Yes.
```

ACTARM versus TRT01A

```         
  If TRT01A is used, then are the values of ACTARM equivalent to values of TRT01A?

    Not applicable - ACTARM is not used.
```

Use of ADaM Treatment Variables in Analysis

```         
  Are both planned and actual treatment variables used in analysis?

    Yes. Planned treatment variables are used for study population and efficacy 
    analyses, whilst actual treatment variables are used for the safety analysis.
    All subjects received the treatment arm to which they were randomised and so
    the planned treatment is equivalent to the actual treatment for all subjects.
```

Use of ADaM Treatment Grouping Variables in Analysis

```         
  Are both planned and actual treatment grouping variables used in analysis?

    Not applicable - treatment grouping variables are not used.
```

## Use of Visit Windowing, Unscheduled Visits, and Record Selection

Was windowing used in one or more analysis datasets?

```         
  Yes
```

Were unscheduled visits used in any analyses?

```         
  Yes
```

## Imputation/Derivation Methods

For ASTDT in ADAE, this date was converted to numeric SAS date from AE.AESTDTC. If the day component is missing, a value of '01' is used. If both the month and day are missing no imputation is performed. See define.xml.

### ADSL - Subject-Level Analysis Dataset

The subject level analysis dataset (ADSL) contains required variables for demographics, treatment groups, and population flags. In addition, it contains other baseline characteristics that were used in both safety and efficacy analyses. All patients in DM were included in ADSL. The following are the key population flags are used in analyses for patients:

-   SAFFL -- Safety Population Flag (all patients having received any study treatment)

-   ITTFL -- Intent-to-Treat Population Flag (all randomized patients)

### ADADAS - ADAS-COG Analysis Dataset

ADADAS contains analysis data from the ADAS-Cog questionnaire, one of the primary efficacy endpoints. It contains one record per subject per parameter (ADAS-Cog questionnaire item) per VISIT. Visits are placed into analysis visits (represented by AVISIT and AVISITN) based on the date of the visit and the visit windows.

### ADAE - Adverse Events Analysis Dataset

ADAE contains one record per reported event per subject. Subjects who did not report any Adverse Events are not represented in this dataset. The data reference for ADAE is the SDTM AE (Adverse Events) domain and there is a 1-1 correspondence between records in the source and this analysis dataset. These records can be linked uniquely by STUDYID, USUBJID, and AESEQ. Events of particular interest (dermatologic) are captured in the customized query variable (CQ01NAM) in this dataset. Since ADAE is a source for ADTTE, the first chronological occurrence based on the start dates (and sequence numbers) of the treatment emergent dermatological events are flagged (AOCC01FL) to facilitate traceability between these two analysis datasets.

### ADLBC - Analysis Dataset Lab Blood Chemistry

ADLBC contains one record per lab analysis parameter, per time point, per subject. ADLBC contains lab chemistry parameters and these data are derived from the SDTM LB (Laboratory Tests) domain. Two sets of lab parameters exist in ADLBC. One set contains the standardised lab value from the LB domain and the second set contains change from previous visit relative to normal range values. In some of the summaries the derived end-of-treatment visit (AVISITN=99) is also presented.

### ADTTE - AE Time To 1st Derm. Event Analysis

ADTTE contains one observation per parameter per subject. ADTTE is specifically for safety analyses of the time to the first dermatologic adverse event. Dermatologic AEs are considered an adverse event of special interest. The key parameter used for the analysis of time to the first dermatological event is with PARAMCD of "TTDE".

## QC Findings and Common Issues

In this Pilot 3 study, our focus was to create a subset of ADaMs based on the CDSICPILOT data, using R. We compared our R generated ADaMs against the CDISCPILOT ADaMs, created in SAS, as a QC step. With these comparisons we listed the QC Findings with explanations as to why these findings exist. We also came across common issues throughout the ADaM generation process, which could be helpful for improvements utilising the CDISC Pilot data in the future. More details can be found in the appendix (Appendix 2 and Appendix 3).

# Appendix

## Appendix 1 : Pilot 3 Installation and Usage

To install and execute the R programs, follow all of the procedures below. Ensure that you note the location of where you downloaded the Pilot 3 eCTD submission files. For demonstration purposes, the procedures below assume the transfer has been saved to this location: C:\\pilot3.

In  addition, create  a  new  directory  to  hold  the  unpacked  Pilot  3  ADaM and tlf programs and files. For demonstration purposes, the procedures below assume the new directory is this location: C:\\pilot3-files, where the unpacked files are shown as the m1 and m5 directories.

![](images/clipboard-641727471.png)

### Installation of R and R Studio

Download and install R 4.2.3 for Windows from <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/4.2.3/>. Then download and run the [R-4.2.3-win.exe](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/4.2.3/R-4.2.3-win.exe) file. Also download RStudio for Windows by visiting <https://dailies.rstudio.com/version/2023.03.1+446.pro1/>

### Create a new R Studio project within the pilot3-files directory

-   Open R Studio

-   Select File -\> New Project

-   In the Create Project dialog box, choose Existing Directory

-   In the Create Project from Existing Directory dialog box, click the Browse button and navigate to the C:\\pilot3-files directory. 

-   Once the location has been confirmed, click the Create Project button.

-   These .Rproj files will be created.

![](images/clipboard-2366076638.png)

::: callout-note
It is possible that the `.Rproj.user` folder may not have generated for you or or may not be visible as it is a hidden folder. If so, this is fine as it will not be necessary in order to run the analysis programs below.
:::

### Installation of R Packages

A minimum set of R packages are required to ensure the Pilot 3 analysis programs are successfully run and the custom package environment used for the application is replicated correctly. Please follow these steps below to install these R packages.

1.  In the `Files` window pane, ensure that this directory

    `~/pilot3-files/m5/datasets/rconsortiumpilot3/analysis/adam/programs`

    has both the `renv-lock.txt` and `pilot3utils_0.0.2.zip` files.

![](images/clipboard-398207727.png)

2.  In the R Studio console install the {remotes} package:

```         
        install.packages("remotes")
```

::: callout-note
-   *The console may display a warning message about Rtools being required to build R packages. **However the Rtools utility is not required to run the programs in this pilot 3 study.***

-   *If you receive a warning showing "cannot open URL  <https://cran.rstudio.com/src/contrib/PACKAGES>'", this is due to the default R Studio option 'Use secure download method for HTTP'. In R Studio, go to Tools → Global Options → Packages, then uncheck the 'Use secure download method for HTTP' option, then retry installation.*
:::

3.  Then,  install the {renv} package, version 0.17.0:

```         
        remotes::install_version("renv", version = "0.17.0")
```

::: callout-note
*If not already set, please verify that the working directory is already set to the project folder.*

1.  `getwd()`

2.  If not pointing to root project directory then do : `setwd("~/pilot3-files")`
:::

4.  Move the 'renv-lock.txt' to the root project directory and rename to 'renv.lock' :

```         
./pilot3-files/m5/datasets/rconsortiumpilot3/analysis/adam/programs/renv-lock.txt 
--> ./pilot3-files/renv.lock
```

![](images/clipboard-3005280222.png)

![](images/clipboard-2461342323.png)

![](images/clipboard-3313061033.png)

5.  Restart the R Session.

    ![](images/clipboard-1220328888.png)

6.  Run the code below, then select option 1 :

    `renv::init()`

    ![](images/clipboard-2206726057.png)

::: callout-note
-   If using `{renv}` for the first time, you may get a 'Welcome' message describing the renv folder structure and its components. It will also list the packages that will be installed from the `renv.lock` file. At the end it will ask you if you want to proceed. Select 'y'.

`Do you want to proceed? [y/N]: y`

-   If after selecting option 1, you may receive a warning such as :

```         
Warning: error downloading 
'https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/2023-03-15/bin/windows/contrib/4.2/
PACKAGES.rds' 
['CreateProcess' failed to run 'C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\curl.exe --config 
"C:\Users\laxamanj\AppData\Local\Temp\RtmpQrN0y7\renv-download-config-
2e24149c3b5f"']
```

-   If so, then run again selecting option 3 instead :

![](images/clipboard-3523315358.png)

-   This warning will show, which can be ignored :

![](images/clipboard-2575842320.png)

-   Open the .Rprofile : C:/pilot3-files/.Rprofile and ensure these 2 lines are there :

    ```         
    Sys.setenv(RENV_DOWNLOAD_FILE_METHOD = "libcurl")
    source("renv/activate.R")
    ```

    e.g.,

![](images/clipboard-4064866343.png)

-   Restart the R Session (ignoring the warning once more), then run `renv::restore()` and select `y` :

![](images/clipboard-1835977816.png)

![](images/clipboard-3983121962.png)

The package installation procedure may take a few minutes or longer depending on internet bandwidth.
:::

7.  Upon completion of installing packages using `{renv}`, please restart your R session.

::: callout-note
After restarting the R session at this stage, running `renv::status()` will show us that the only package uninstalled is the {pilot3utils} package.

```         
The following package(s) are used in this project, but are not installed:

    pilot3utils

Consider installing these packages (for example, using `renv::install()`).
Then, use `renv::snapshot()` to record these packages in the lockfile.
Use `renv::dependencies()` to see where these packages appear to be used.
```

We may ignore this as we will be installing the {pilot3utils} package in the following steps.
:::

8.  Install the {pilot3utils} package following the steps below :

    -   In R Studio, navigate to your `Packages` window pane, then click on `Install`.

    ![](images/clipboard-3779894600.png)

    -   A new window called `Install Packages` will show up.

    ![](images/clipboard-695201532.png)

    -   In the field `Install from:`, click on the drop-down menu and select `Package Archive File (.zip; .tar.gz)`

    ![](images/clipboard-1218742851.png)

::: callout-note
This drop-down option is only available on a local Windows installation, not on linux systems.
:::

-   In the field `Package Archive`, click on `Browse...` and navigate to this directory to point to the `{pilot3utils}` package :

`~/pilot3-files/m5/datasets/rconsortiumpilot3/analysis/adam/programs/pilot3utils_0.0.2.zip`

![](images/clipboard-3031640318.png)

-   In the field `Install to Library:`, you may keep this at its default setting.

-   Click `Install`.

    ![](images/clipboard-2776928439.png)

9.  **Set the paths to run the analysis programs**

INPUT path: to rerun the analysis programs, define the path variable

-   Path for SDTM data: path\$sdtm

-   Path to ADaM specifications : path\$adam

OUTPUT path: to save the analysis datasets and  results, define the path variable

-   Path for ADaM data: path\$adam

-   Path for output TLFs: path\$output. 

All these paths must be defined before executing the analysis programs. You may do so by first entering the full file path directories to where the SDTM is currently stored and where the ADaMs and Outputs will be generated upon execution of the analysis programs.

::: callout-note
Before executing the example file paths below, first navigate to the `~/pilot3-files/m5/datasets/rconsortiumpilot3/analysis` folder and do this :

1.  Create a copy of the `adam` folder in the same location and rename the new folder copy as `adam-reviewer`. The reason for creating this `adam-reviewer` folder (e.g ../adam-reviewer) is to keep the original ADaM datasets generated by the sponsor (e.g ../adam) so they will not get overwritten upon reviewers' execution of the analysis programs.

![](images/clipboard-2507647878.png)

![](images/clipboard-2575673838.png)

![](images/clipboard-3211797445.png)

2.  In the same location create a new folder called `output` in order to write the outputs in this folder upon reviewers' execution of the analysis output programs.

![](images/clipboard-3715719545.png)

![](images/clipboard-366164445.png)

```         
# Modify path to the sdtm, adam and output location
# Output saved in current folder

path <- list(
  sdtm = "Enter full file path to the sdtm data here",
  adam = "Enter full file path to where adam data will be written and 
  sourced here",
  output = "Enter full file path to where outputs should be saved here"
  )
  
# For example

path <- list(
  sdtm = "~/pilot3-files/m5/datasets/rconsortiumpilot3/tabulations/sdtm",
  adam = "~/pilot3-files/m5/datasets/rconsortiumpilot3/analysis/
          adam-reviewer/datasets",
  output = "~/pilot3-files/m5/datasets/rconsortiumpilot3/analysis/output"
  )
```

-   "adsl.r"

-   "adae.r"

-   "adadas.r"

-   "adlbc.r"

-   "adtte.r"

-   "tlf-demographic.r"

-   "tlf-efficacy.r"

-   "tlf-kmplot.r"

## Appendix 2 : QC Findings

### ADSL

The R-generated ADSL matches the original ADSL from [CDISC pilot data](https://github.com/phuse-org/TestDataFactory/tree/main/Updated/TDF_ADaM), besides the following mismatches:

-   Subject 01-702-1082 has a missing value for BMIBLGR1 in the R-generated ADSL, whilst BMIBLGR1 = "\<25" in the original ADSL. This is an issue with the original ADSL, as this subject's BMI at baseline (BMIBL) is missing and therefore the subject shouldn't be assigned a BMI at baseline group.

### ADAE

The R-generated ADAE matches the original ADAE from [CDISC pilot data](https://github.com/phuse-org/TestDataFactory/tree/main/Updated/TDF_ADaM), besides the following mismatches: There is an issue with the original CDISC pilot dataset. ADURN is blank, where AESEQ is (5, 6, 7, 8) for the original CDISC dataset for Subject below:

```

Because it seems the original SDTM.AE.AESTDTC was missing Day, where it seems the original ADAE derivation for ADURN was probably using this date instead of the imputed date. Because day is missing in AESTDTC, ADURN can't derive days.

``` r
> ae %>% filter(USUBJID=='01-716-1418') %>% select(USUBJID,AESTDTC,AESEQ) %>% 
    arrange(AESEQ)
# A tibble: 10 × 3

10 01-716-1418 2013-09-26    10
```

but the same records, derived in the Pilot 3 dataset do show a calculation since we are using the imputed ASTDT, per the define (ADURN=AENDT-ASTDT+1).

``` r
#AE.AESTDTC, converted to a numeric SAS date. Some events with partial dates 
#are imputed in a conservative manner. If the day component is missing, a value 
#of '01' is used. If both the month and day are missing no imputation is 
#performed as these dates clearly indicate a start prior to the beginning of 
#treatment. There are no events with completely missing start dates.

This latter approach should be the correct approach.

Due to this, we have outlined the expected differences here :

``` r
> diffdf(adae, adae_orig, keys = c("STUDYID", "USUBJID", "AESEQ"))
Differences found between the objects!

A summary is given below.

There are columns in BASE and COMPARE with differing attributes !!
All rows are shown in table below
```

1.  ADURN values will be populated in Pilot 3 (i.e. under `BASE`), following the latter derivation approach (i.e. ADURN=AENDT-ASTDT+1) for Subject 01-716-1418 where AESEQ is (5, 6, 7, 8) specified in define.

``` r
All rows are shown in table below

```

2.  ADURU should be set to 'DAYS' (i.e. under `BASE`) instead of 'DAY' when ADURN is not missing. Updated in Pilot 3 define.

### ADLBC

The R-generated ADLBC matches the original ADLBC from [CDISC pilot data](https://github.com/phuse-org/TestDataFactory/tree/main/Updated/TDF_ADaM), besides the following mismatches:

Three variables from R-generated ADLBC have class date while the same variables are numeric in the CDISC ADLBC. We opted to keep the date class in our R-generated ADLB.

``` r
> diffdf(adlbc, qc_adlbc, keys = c("STUDYID", "USUBJID", "AVISIT", "LBSEQ"))
Differences found between the objects!

A summary is given below.

### ADADAS

The R-generated ADADAS matches original ADADAS from [CDISC pilot data](https://github.com/phuse-org/TestDataFactory/tree/main/Updated/TDF_ADaM), except for the records where `PARAMCD=ACTOT, DTYPE=LOCF`. This is an issue from the CDISC ADADAS.

-   CDISC SDTM/QS : 818 records for `QSTESTCD=ACTOT`
-   CDISC ADaM/ADADAS : 1040 records for `PARAMCD=ACTOT`, 799 (directly from QS, **should be 818**) + 241 imputed records (`DTYPE=LOCF`)
-   ADADAS generated by R: 1040 records for `PARAMCD=ACTOT`, 818 (directly from QS) + 222 imputed records (`DTYPE=LOCF`)

Take a detailed example USUBJID="01-701-1294"

CDISC QS:

``` r
> qs %>% filter(QSTESTCD=="ACTOT") %>% 
+   select(USUBJID, QSSEQ, VISIT, QSTESTCD, QSTEST,QSSTRESN) %>% 
+   filter(USUBJID=="01-701-1294")

```

CDISC ADADAS :

**For the record with `QSSEQ=5045` and `AVISIT=Week 8`, `DTYPE` is populated as `LOCF` , but this record is directly from `qs` dataset, not imputed.**

``` r

### ADTTE

The R-generated ADTTE matches original ADTTE from [CDISC pilot data](https://github.com/phuse-org/TestDataFactory/tree/main/Updated/TDF_ADaM) except for minor SAS format discrepancies. Since this adtte was generated in R compared to SAS formats, the columns Type & Length in the define should be sufficient enough to describe the attributes of these variables.

``` r
> diffdf(adtte, qc_adtte, keys = c("STUDYID", "USUBJID", "PARAMCD", "SRCDOM", "STARTDT"))

### Label discrepancies

In Pilot3, variable labels were updated per ADaM IG 1.1, which caused some discrepancies with original CDISC pilot data label.

## Appendix 3 : Common Issues

### Package issue tracking

#### Package issues

-   `haven::read_xpt()` Some attributes are dropped after using `haven::write_xpt()` `haven::read_xpt()`, e.g., type, length. to do: further check

-   `xportr::xportr_length()` `NA_character_` is considered as length 2 - [issue resolved on Dec 14, 2022](https://github.com/tidyverse/haven/issues/699) to do: to be incorporated in pilot3

#### Potential improvement

-   `metatools::build_from_derived()` https://github.com/pharmaverse/metatools/issues/46 Not urgent feature but nice to have - especially when `define.xml` is not in good quality

### Knowledge sharing

Summary of similarities and differences between packages, to help user identify the best tool that suits the need. Maybe this could go to [Bayer SAS2R catalog](https://bayer-group.github.io/sas2r/) in the future,

#### `metatools` vs `xportr`

-   `metatools::set_variable_labels()` vs `xportr::xportr_label()`

#### `xportr` vs `haven`

-   `xportr::xportr_write()` vs `haven::write_xpt()`

#### `diffdf` vs `arsenal`

-   `diffdf::diffdf()` vs `arsenal::comparedf()`
